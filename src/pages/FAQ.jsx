        Welcome to our family!
        <em>What is this website?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Before Vega was born, Leif and I had some tough talks about her and our
        future privacy. Faced with several online options, we decided to curate
        a private photo collection that we had complete control over instead of
        broadcasting our family across email and social media to reach our
        people. This website represents our humble attempt to preserve our
        family&#39;s privacy while still sharing our special moments with people
        we love and trust.

        Downloading
      </Title>
      <p>
        You are welcome to download images for personal use, however we ask that
        you refrain from posting anything on social media and use discretion
        when sharing by email/ text/ IM.

        Clicking the download button on an image will save a full resolution
        copy of that image to your device. If you want to print physical copies
        of images, we highly recommend using{' '}
        <a href="https://www.mpix.com/products/prints">MPIX</a>. This service is
        popular with professional photographers for everything from school
        portraits to wedding photography. In our experience, print services with
        quick turnarounds such as Walgreens, Costco and Shutterfly produce
        significantly lower quality images regardless of the resolution of the
        digital file.

        Sharing

      <p>
        The best way to share images by email/ text/ IM is by sharing the link.
        This simplifies things for you, introduces the viewer to our website,
        and allows us to maintain control over who is accessing our content.
        Please know that shared links will prompt the viewer to enter or request
